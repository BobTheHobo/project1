# Development Instructions
## Godot .NET and .NET SDK
1. Download Godot Engine - .NET version from [Godot](https://godotengine.org/download/windows/) which is needed for C# development
2. Download the [.NET SDK](https://dotnet.microsoft.com/en-us/download). Both version 8 and 9 should work, version 9 is recommended.
## Configure an external editor
We like VSCode and JetBrains Rider but pick what you like and follow [these instructions](https://docs.godotengine.org/en/stable/tutorials/scripting/c_sharp/c_sharp_basics.html#configuring-an-external-editor)

For more information check out the [Godot docs on C#](https://docs.godotengine.org/en/stable/tutorials/scripting/c_sharp/c_sharp_basics.html)
